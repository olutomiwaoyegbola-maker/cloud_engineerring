**# Cloud Engineering Training System**

**Repository Overview**

**Purpose**

This repository serves as the authoritative index and structural specification for a multi-phase technical training system composed of 60 primary projects and 27 mini projects.

It defines the system’s scope, progression, and design intent.

It does not contain project implementations.

Each project is implemented in its own dedicated repository with independent code, documentation, and Git history. 

This repository exists to make the system coherent, navigable, and auditable.

**Problem Statement**
Unstructured self-directed technical training commonly fails due to:

-Fragmented project selection

-Lack of cumulative progression

-Inconsistent or superficial version control practices

-Inability to demonstrate reasoning, tradeoffs, or system understanding.

This system is designed to correct those failure modes by enforcing a structured progression of work, explicit decision-making, and verifiable artifacts.

**System Structure**

The training system is organized into three phases, each increasing in scope and rigor:

**Phase 1 — Foundations**
Core Linux operation, scripting fundamentals, and baseline Git discipline

**Phase 2 — Integration**
System troubleshooting, security fundamentals, and operational workflows

**Phase 3 — Mastery**
Advanced system administration and cloud-oriented operations

Each phase consists of two categories of work:

Primary Projects
Full problem-solving units that integrate multiple concepts

Mini Projects
Constrained exercises designed to validate specific technical competencies

Projects are serialized within each phase to reflect intended progression. No time-based assumptions are embedded in the structure.

**Repository Scope**

This repository contains:

-The complete project index

-Phase and project descriptions

-Mini project definitions and objectives

-Cross-cutting documentation references

This repository does not contain:

-Source code for individual projects

-Step-by-step implementation instructions

-Prebuilt solutions or templates

All implementation details live in the corresponding project repositories.

**Navigation Model**

To evaluate or follow the system:

-Review the phase structure to understand progression

-Select a primary project by its serialized position

-Navigate to the corresponding project repository

-Review the project README for scope, assumptions, and decisions

-Examine Git history and artifacts to assess execution

This repository defines what exists and why it exists; execution is demonstrated elsewhere.

**Standards and Governance**

Project-wide standards—such as Git usage expectations, documentation requirements, and evaluation criteria—are defined in separate reference documents.

These standards apply across all project repositories and increase in strictness across phases.
                          

This repository is a living system specification.
Structure may evolve as later phases are executed and validated, but changes are expected to be incremental and document
